This is your first post! You can use markdown to format this.
Markdown is a format designed for writers! coconut uses markdown for any content you want to enter.
Articles go in the `articles` directory in your coconut installation dir.

Technically, you can put pages anywhere under `static`, you just have to specify the url path for the page and the file path in conf.yaml.

Here's some examples of what you can do:
    
- *italics* by putting '\*' around some words 
- **bold** by putting '\*\*' around words
- lists by starting each line with a dash and a space '- '

You can do code by enclosing the block with three backtics '\`\`\`'
or by indenting each line with four spaces. For inline  `code` you can enclose the snippet with single backtics '\`'

```
    func test() {
        5+4
    }
    //see?
```
