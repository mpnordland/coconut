This is your first post! You can use markdown to format this.
Markdown is a format designed for writers! coconut uses markdown for any content you want to enter.
Articles go in the `articles` directory in your coconut installation dir.

Technically, you can put pages anywhere, you just have to specify the url path for the page and the file path in conf.yaml.

Here's some examples of what you can do:
    
- *italics* by putting '\*' around some words 
- **bold** by putting '\*\*' around words
- lists by starting each line with a dash and a space '- '

You can do code by enclosing the block with three backtics '\`\`\`'
or by indenting each line with four spaces. For inline  `code` you can enclose the snippet with single backtics '\`'

```
    func test() {
        5+4
    }
    //see?
```
